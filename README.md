# ws2812b-NTPClock

You can take any number of LEDs, better get 60 or more than 60.

clock runs on ws2812b led strip connected to ESP8266 and time taken from NTP server.

just un-comment these three lines, connect strip to GPIO3, and see if it works

//const char ssid[] = "xxx";  //  your network SSID (name)

//const char pass[] = "xxx";       // your network password

//const uint16_t PixelCount = 76; 

This is how it should work
